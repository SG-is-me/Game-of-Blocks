## 2048
I made a game (in class 12th) using basic OOPS concepts.

#### RULES
The rules are simple. You just need to move the tiles and every time you move one, another tile pops up in a random manner anywhere in the box. When two tiles with the same number on them collide with one another as you move them, they will merge into one tile with the sum of the numbers written on them initially. <br><br>

<b><i>HOW TO WIN</i></b><br><br>
If you manage to get 2048 on the screen, you win!!!
