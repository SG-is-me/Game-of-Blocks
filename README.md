# GAME OF BLOCKS
This is the repository for the SnT Council's project 'Game of blocks'.

In this project we were taught about :
- Basics of blockchains
- Consensus mechanisms
- Ethereum and smart contracts
- Solidity - a programming language
- Game theory
- Decentralization in auctions, voting, school choice mechanisms etc

Mentor: [Atharv Singh Patlan](https://github.com/AthaSSiN)

This repository contains all the assignments that we were supposed to do. Along with each assignment, there is a corresponding README.md file explaining what it is about.

---

## Assignment 1: Making Nonce less than the target

Input a string and give the output as the nonce such that the hash is less than the target hash, which is `0x00000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF`.  

---

## Assignment 2: Making a basic smart Contract

Implemented with Solidity, User has to, preferably, either use [Remix IDE](http://remix.ethereum.org) or Truffle with npm.  
Two contracts implemented are `MetaCoins` and `Loans` which acts as a loan deposit and settling contract. 

---

## Assignment 3: Implementing a Voting Mechanism

Implemented in Solidity, the contract implements a voting mechanism _Single Non-Transferable Vote (SNTV)_. Through this contract, we have ensured that the process of voting is decentralized.

---

## Assignment 4: Implementing an Auction Mechanism.

Implemented in Solidity, this is a smart contract which is based on the school choice mechanism _Columbus Student Assignment Mechanism_.

## EXTRA

A webpage which takes in a wallet address on ethereum cryptocurrency chain. [Link](https://github.com/somyagupta18/FullStack-Web3)

- It works using Web3 and focusses on the ethereum cryptocurrency chain.
- It gives you the metadata of all the NFTs owned by a particular address.
- It can also take in a user address and give you the account balance or the history of transactions.
